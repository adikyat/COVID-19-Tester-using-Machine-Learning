# COVID-19-Tester-using-Machine-Learning (POC)
- The dataset used for training has some data which is officially available for research in COVID-19 and some I have added randomly by referring to various common facts and news articles about COVID-19 because the required data for every feature for my project is not available yet(as of May 2020)
- This model uses travel history, so it will detect the persons who have not yet acquired any symptoms but would be acquiring.
- This idea will cure the patient in the early stages of disease and will also give the idea about the quantity of medical and administrative facilities needed.
- The training data is very less , though it gives an idea about the importance of every feature
- This is basically a MVP ,ofcourse for final model the dataset should be more relevant and vast

#### Importance of features :-
